# Sponsor uvspeed

**beyondBINARY quantum-prefixed development platform**

uvspeed is an open-source platform that reimagines how code is structurally addressed — replacing binary `{0, 1}` with a 9-symbol directional prefix system `{+1, 1, -1, +0, 0, -0, +n, n, -n}`. It spans 20+ languages and ships as zero-install web tools, a CLI, and a native desktop app.

---

## Why Sponsor

- **Solo-built, open source** — every tool, every page, every line is maintained by one developer
- **16 web apps** shipping today: terminal emulator, video streaming, keyboard analytics, architecture visualizer, game engine, audio tools, dashboards
- **Novel research** — the quantum prefix system is a new way to think about code structure, applicable to AI training, code review, and IDE tooling
- **Zero-install philosophy** — everything runs in a browser or via `pip install`

Your sponsorship directly funds:
- Full-time development and maintenance
- Server costs for live demos and CI/CD
- Hardware for multi-device testing (phones, tablets, XR headsets)
- Research into AI-assisted prefix classification
